                <p>By choosing to accept a travel companion, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible
                    for your personal safety. We recommend conducting thorough background checks, meeting in public
                    places before traveling, and informing family or friends of your travel plans and companion details.
                    Our platform does not vet travel companions and cannot guarantee their trustworthiness. Use caution
                    and good judgment when making travel arrangements. We are not liable for any incidents, accidents,
                    or disputes that may arise from traveling with a companion met through our service.</p>
